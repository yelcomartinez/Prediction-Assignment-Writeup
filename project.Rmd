##Practical Machine Learning Course Project  

## Background  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here:  http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).   

## Data Sources  
The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

## Results  
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.  

1. Your submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).  

2. You should also apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above. Please submit your predictions in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading. See the programming assignment for additional details.  

## Reproducibility  
The next packages are used to get the results.

```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(rattle)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)
```  

Seed:  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
```  

## Getting Data  
Working directory.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/Yelco/Desktop/8. Practical Machine Learning/week 4/course project")
```  

Downloading the dataset to the data folder in the working directory.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile = trainFile, method = "curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile = testFile, method = "curl")
}
rm(trainUrl)
rm(testUrl)
```  

## Reading Data  
Read the two csv files into two data frames.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
trainRaw <- read.csv(trainFile)
testRaw <- read.csv(testFile)
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
rm(trainFile)
rm(testFile)
```  
The training data set contains 19622 observations and 160 variables while the test data set contains 20 observations and 160 variables.

The `classe` variable in the training set is the outcome to predict.  

## Cleaning Data  
Cleaning the dataset and discard observations with missing values as well as some meaningless variables.  

1. Cleaning the 'Near Zero Variance' Variables.  

```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
NZV <- nearZeroVar(trainRaw, saveMetrics = TRUE)
head(NZV, 20)
training01 <- trainRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
testing01 <- testRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
dim(training01)
dim(testing01)
rm(trainRaw)
rm(testRaw)
rm(NZV)
```  

2. Removing some columns of the dataset that are not importantto the accelerometer measurements.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
regex <- grepl("^X|timestamp|user_name", names(training01))
training <- training01[, !regex]
testing <- testing01[, !regex]
rm(regex)
rm(training01)
rm(testing01)
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```  

3. Removing columns that contain `NA's`.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
cond <- (colSums(is.na(training)) == 0)
training <- training[, cond]
testing <- testing[, cond]
rm(cond)
```  

Correlation Matrix of Columns in the Training Data set.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
corrplot(cor(training[, -length(names(training))]), method = "color", tl.cex = 0.5)
```  

## Partitioning Training Set  
Split the cleaned training set into a training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). We will use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in future steps.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
set.seed(12345) 
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 0.70, list = FALSE)
validation <- training[-inTrain, ]
training <- training[inTrain, ]
rm(inTrain)
```  

## Data Modelling  

### Decision Tree  
Fit a predictive model for activity recognition using 'Decision Tree' algorithm.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
modelTree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "class")
prp(modelTree)
```  

Estimating the performance of the model on the validation data set.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
predictTree <- predict(modelTree,validation, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictTree)
accuracy <- postResample(predictTree, validation$classe)
ose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictTree)$overall[1])
rm(predictTree)
rm(modelTree)
```  

The Estimated Accuracy of the Random Forest Model is 74% and the Estimated Out-of-Sample Error is 26%.  

### Random Forest
Fit a predictive model for activity recognition using Random Forest algorithm.

Use 5-fold cross validation when applying the algorithm.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
modelRF <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "rf", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 5), ntree = 250)
modelRF
```  

Estimating the performance of the model on the validation data set.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
predictRF <- predict(modelRF, validation)
confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictRF)
accuracy <- postResample(predictRF, validation$classe)
ose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictRF)$overall[1])
rm(predictRF)
```  

The Estimated Accuracy of the Random Forest Model is `r accuracy[1]*100`% and the Estimated Out-of-Sample Error is `r ose*100`%.  
Random Forests yielded better Results, as expected!  

## Predicting The Manner of Exercise for Test Data Set  
Appling the Random Forest model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source.   
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
rm(accuracy)
rm(ose)
predict(modelRF, testing[, -length(names(testing))])
```  

## Generating Files to submit as answers for the Assignment  
Generating files with predictions to submit for assignment.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("./Solution/problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
  }
}
```  
Generating the Files.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pml_write_files(predict(modelRF, testing[, -length(names(testing))]))
rm(modelRF)
rm(training)
rm(testing)
rm(validation)
rm(pml_write_files)
```
